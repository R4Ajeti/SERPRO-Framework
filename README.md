## How the framework works

* Use a link tag in the header of your html file to include the framework. Use a relative path to specify the path of the file.
* To know more about the available classes you can use, open the framework.css file to see various possibilities but for some few common classes, you can use;
-bg: it stands for background and to specify a color, you attach the name of the color at the end to of bg. example: bg-red.
-displace: Represents css floats. It takes the attributes left or right.
-The grid system is a little bit similar to that of bootstrap where you define a column and the number of space it should occupy depending on the screen size.
-display-visibile: It's is the same as the css visibility attribute and could be display-visible or display-no-visible.
